//:	C	#	 	 	 	 	 	 	N/A	        Initiate a temperature conversion; the conversion process takes a maximum of 750 milliseconds. The value returned by the :GT# command will not be valid until the conversion process completes.
//:	F	G	#	 	 	 	 	 	N/A	        Go to the new position as set by the ":SNYYYY#" command.
//:	F	Q	#	 	 	 	 	 	N/A	        Immediately stop any focus motor movement.
//:	G	C	#	 	 	 	 	 	XX#	        Returns the temperature coefficient where XX is a two-digit signed (2’s complement) hex number.
//:	G	D	#	 	 	 	 	 	XX#	        Returns the current stepping delay where XX is a two-digit unsigned hex number. See the :SD# command for a list of possible return values.
//:	G	H	#	 	 	 	 	 	00# OR FF#	Returns "FF#" if the focus motor is half-stepped otherwise return "00#"
//:	G	I	#	 	 	 	 	 	00# OR 01#	Returns "00#" if the focus motor is not moving, otherwise return "01#"
//:	G	N	#	 	 	 	 	 	YYYY#	      Returns the new position previously set by a ":SNYYYY" command where YYYY is a four-digit unsigned hex number.
//:	G	P	#	 	 	 	 	 	YYYY#	      Returns the current position where YYYY is a four-digit unsigned hex number.
//:	G	T	#	 	 	 	 	 	YYYY#	      Returns the current temperature where YYYY is a four-digit signed (2’s complement) hex number.
//:	G	V	#	 	 	 	 	 	DD#	        Get the version of the firmware as a two-digit decimal number where the first digit is the major version number, and the second digit is the minor version number.
//:	S	C	X	X	#	 	 	 	N/A	        Set the new temperature coefficient where XX is a two-digit, signed (2’s complement) hex number.
//:	S	D	X	X	#	 	 	 	N/A	        Set the new stepping delay where XX is a two-digit, unsigned hex number. Valid values to send are 02, 04, 08, 10 and 20, which correspond to a stepping delay of 250, 125, 63, 32 and 16 steps per second respectively.
//:	S	F	#	 	 	 	 	 	N/A	        Set full-step mode.
//:	S	H	#	 	 	 	 	 	N/A	        Set half-step mode.
//:	S	N	Y	Y	Y	Y	#	 	N/A	        Set the new position where YYYY is a four-digit unsigned hex number.
//:	S	P	Y	Y	Y	Y	#	 	N/A	        Set the current position where YYYY is a four-digit unsigned hex number.
//:	+	#	 	 	 	 	 	 	N/A	        Activate temperature compensation focusing.
//:	-	#	 	 	 	 	 	 	N/A	        Disable temperature compensation focusing.
//:	P	O	X	X	#	 	 	 	N/A	        Temperature calibration offset, XX is a two-digit signed hex number, in half degree increments.
//: Y   M   #                       N/A         Enhance temperature reading (0.125 degree)
//: Y   B   X   X   #               N/A         Set backlash where XX is a two-digit unsigned hex number
//: Z   B   #                       XX#         Get backlash

//: Z   T   #                       YYYY#       Get max steps
//: Y   X   X   X   #               N/A         Set TempComp threshold where XX is a two-digit unsigned hex number in unit of 0.25 degree
//: Z   X   #                       XX#         Get TempComp threshold
